# Performance Task

This is a simple "Guess the Number" game.  The computer generates a random number from 1 to 1000 and the user has 10 tries to guess it.  Each guess, the computer states if the guess is too high or low.  

For the student version, there is nothing but a blank main method.  No import statnements are provided.  We haven't covered Math.random() so I provided that line in the instructions.
