# Labs

There are 3 labs in this secion covering some basic intoductory loop concepts.  There is a pdf of instructions for each lab.  There is a method already created for each problem.  Students are to use those methods.  Obviously the student verson has blank methods.

Topics Covered:
- Basic iteration and integer manipulation
- Accumulation
- Using user inputs to manage loop behavior
- Sentinal controlled loops

Problems need to match the desired output exactly.  Otherwise the test cases will likely fail even if their math is correct.  At a bare minimum it's good practice to give a client exactly what they ask for, even if you think another way sounds better.
