## Autograder

The is for the lab portion.  The performance task must still be graded individually.

The gradle.build file is what GitHub Classroom needs in order to run the test cases in the tests_DO_NOT_EDIT package.  The project does not have a gradle nature.  For more information use the "Test Section" link above.
